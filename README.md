If you're a driver, you can post a ride offer on RideShare and set your own price for the ride. You can specify the starting location, destination, and departure time, as well as any other relevant details such as number of seats, recurrence, price, smoking avaliabilty. Everyone can then respond to the posts to join the ride.
